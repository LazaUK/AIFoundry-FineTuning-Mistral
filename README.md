# Fine-Tuning Mistral-7B in Azure AI Foundry

This guide walks you through the process of fine-tuning Mistral 7B AI model using **Azure AI Foundry**. It covers steps of checking prerequisites, configuring your environment and submitting a fine-tuning job using Managed Identity.

> [!NOTE]
> The Python code and training datasets in this repo are adapted from Microsoft's [Azure Machine Learning examples](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/sdk/python/jobs/finetuning) repo.

## ✅ Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- **Azure Subscription**: Your subscription must be allow-listed for MaaP (Model-as-a-Platform) preview;
- **Azure AI Project**: Make sure your project is created and accessible;
- **Managed Identity**: If using a **System-Assigned Managed Identity, you should have all the required roles pre-assigned. If using a **User-Assigned Managed Identity**, ensure that it has the **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role to access the **AI Hub's storage account**;
- **Python Packages**: Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed for interacting with Azure AI Foundry.
``` PowerShell
pip install azure-identity azure-ai-ml
```

## ⚙️ Environment Setup
Set up your environment variables to make provided Jupyter notebook work:
